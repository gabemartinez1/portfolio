I've been product making since 2016 when I interned at Over App (now part of GoDaddy), focusing on bringing animation tools so content creators and small businesses could create more engaging content.
Since then, I was a PM at Microsoft focusing on speech interactions and accessibility opportunities for Windows. 
I then came back to design at Microsoft and was part of the design team that made Windows 11. 
I now work on Microsoft Teams where I design experiences for remote and hybrid school and work by enabling more interactive collaboration experiences in meetings.

What brings me to product design everyday are 3 core traits: 
<strong>I love talking and learning from customers.</strong>
It is humbling to understand how millions of people use products I've designed everyday and figure out how to better unlock their creativity.
<strong>I am deeply curious about how to use technology to move human creativity and resilience forward.</strong> I create tools that people use to run the world and build diverse communities.
<strong>I like to solve problems that grow businesses with novel techniques, delight, and simplicity.</strong>
