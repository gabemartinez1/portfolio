            <p>
                I graduated with from Harvard College an A.B. in Computer Science and a Secondary in Architectural Design.
                <p>
                    I've been product making since 2016 when I interned at Over (now part of GoDaddy), focusing on bringing animation tools so content creators and small businesses could create more engaging content.
                    Since then, I was a PM at Microsoft focusing on speech interactions and accessibility opportunities for Windows. 
                    I then came back to design at Microsoft and was part of the design team that made Windows 11. 
                    I now work on Microsoft Teams where I design experiences for remote and hybrid school and work by enabling more interactive collaboration experiences in meetings.

                </p>
                <p>
                    What brings me to product design everyday are 3 core traits: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>I love talking and learning from users.</strong> It is humbling to understand how millions of people use products I've designed everyday and figure out how to better unlock their creativity.</li>
                        <li><strong>I am deeply curious about how to use technology to move human creativity and resilience forward.</strong> I create tools that people use to run the world and build diverse communities.</li>
                        <li><strong>I like to solve problems that grow businesses with novel techniques, delight, and simplicity.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    
                </p>

                    Caroline went the extra mile on every single project she took on and produced incredibly high quality work. She cross-collaborated with individuals in various roles and showed her professional and organizational skills by bringing complex and nuanced
                    projects over the finish line. One of the most important projects she worked on was to help implement a monitoring system to test the latency that clients experience with our sync partners and report out on other poor behaviors like
                    illegal redirects, a high number of redirects, and dead links. This had an immediate and tangible impact on our syncing technology, which is one of our core functions as a business. Caroline’s full ownership of this project should
                    speak to how much trust and responsibility she earned in such a short period of time – most interns would not have been able to take on this amount of work and responsibility, nor would we have trusted them to do so. All of this goes
                    back to her eagerness to work on complex problems and natural ability to solve them.

                    I worked with Caroline at brainbot for the Raiden project (Ethereum 2nd Layer Payment Channel Network) for 4 weeks. She redesigned the Raiden WebUI and created a new design for the Raiden Explorer. She quickly understood the use case and delivered a nice
                    consistent design in great quality while improving the user experience. She quickly incorporated feedback from developers and users. She has been motivated and open for new ideas. Caroline is an asset for any team.
