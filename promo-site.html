            <p class="heading">Overview</p>
            <p>I created this website as a promotion for a drawing Instagram account. The site uses a parallax scrolling effect as you scroll through each word of the Instagram handle, and was made with only HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p class="heading">Inspiration</p>
            <p>I completed SuperHi’s online course Foundation HTML, CSS + JavaScript, after graduating from college. Despite computer science degree, I had limited experience with web development and wanted to learn more. My first homework assignment in
                the course, which can be found <a class="text-link" target="_blank" href="https://homework-1-86.superhi.com/">here</a>, inspired me to design and develop my own version.</p>
            <p class="heading">Typography</p>
            <p>I chose a simple geometric sans-serif font that would not compete with or distract from the hand-drawn elements but would, at the same time, provide a nice contrast.</p>
            <div class="screens raiden-screens"><img src="assets/instagram/typeface.png"></div>
            <p>In Adobe Illustrator, on a desktop-sized artboard, I typed out <i>caroline</i> and <i>sometimes</i> in the Spartan typeface. I sized them how I wanted, aligned them in the center, and exported the artboards as SVGs.</p>
            <p class="heading">Visual Elements</p>
            <p class="sub-head">Colors</p>
            <p>I wanted to use colors that matched the aesthetic of the Instagram grid.</p>
            <div class="screens raiden-screens"><img src="assets/instagram/grid.png"></div>
            <p>I used coolors.co to select a color palette for the site and generated palettes until I came across some fun, bright colors similar to those in the grid.</p>
            <div class="screens raiden-screens"><img src="assets/instagram/colors.png"></div>
            <p class="sub-head">Hand-drawn Elements</p>
            <p>I hand drew the word <i>draws</i>, image traced the sketch to get a vector image, and followed the same steps as the typographic elements to obtain a usable SVG. Then I selected one of my favorite drawings that had already been vectorized
                and repeated the process.</p>
            <div class="screens insta-drawn">
                <img src="assets/instagram/hand-drawn-1.png">
                <img src="assets/instagram/hand-drawn-2.png">
            </div>
            <p class="heading">Development</p>
            <p>Once I had collected all of the site’s assets, it was easy to put the whole site together. Since a completed homework assignment inspired this project, I could borrow most of the code I had already written and just replace the CSS where needed.</p>
            <p class="heading">Launch</p>
            <p>I decided to use Github pages to host my site for a few reasons. First, since this was a personal and mostly experimental project, I didn’t want to pay for hosting or a custom domain. Using Github pages enabled me to publish my site on a free
                default domain. Also, I am already comfortable with the platform and can use version control to make changes to the site in the future.</p>
